# Cybersecurity, Hacking, and Pentesting Research

This repository contains research on cybersecurity, hacking, and penetration testing.

## Key Areas:

*   **Ethical Hacking:** Techniques for identifying vulnerabilities and improving security.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating attacks to evaluate system security.
*   **Cybersecurity Norms:**  Developing and reinforcing standards for space systems.
*   **AI in Cybersecurity:**  Using AI for ethical hacking, automation, and threat detection.

## Research Highlights:

*   **LLM Augmented Pentesting:** Integration of Large Language Models into penetration testing workflows (Goyal et al., 2024).
*   **PenTest++:** An AI-augmented system that integrates automation with generative AI (GenAI) to optimise ethical hacking workflows (Al-Sinani, Mitchell, 2025).
*   **Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity:** Discusses the ethical considerations, legal contexts and challenges that arises with ethical hacking (Asif et al., 2024).
*   **Coherence-driven inference for cybersecurity:** LLMs can compile weighted graphs on natural language data to enable automatic coherence-driven inference (CDI) relevant to red and blue team operations in cybersecurity (Huntsman, 2025).

More research and files to be added soon.
